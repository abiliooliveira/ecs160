\section*{The System}
The system must hold a schema by itself with the purpose of declaring its elements as well as its invariants:
\begin{schema}{HOMESTAYAPP}
	\Xi STUDENTS\\
	\Xi HOSTS\\
	managers : \power Admin\\
	requests : Profile \rightarrow Profile
	authorized_requests : Profile \rightarrow Profile
\where
	students \subseteq Profile\\
	hosts \subseteq Profile\\
	students \cap Hosts = \emptyset\\
	\dom requests \subset students\\
	\ran requests \subset hosts\\
	requests \cap authorized_requests = \emptyset\\
	\forall s : students | s \in \dom Requests \bullet \#(s \dres Requests) \leq 3
\end{schema}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Actors}
\begin{schema}{STUDENTS}
	students : \power Profile\\
	pet\_preference : Pet \rightarrow \nat\\

\where

\end{schema}

\begin{schema}{HOSTS}

\where
